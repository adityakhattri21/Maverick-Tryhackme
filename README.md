### Introduction:

Hello everyone! My name is Aditya, and I'm a Cybersecurity Enthusiast from India. As a newbie in the domain, I have embarked on an exciting journey of learning security principles through solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. In this repository, I have curated a collection of writeups detailing my experiences of successfully "ROOTing" various CTF rooms. In these writeups, I aim to provide a comprehensive and descriptive account of each step I took to capture the flag, along with the reasoning behind my actions.<br>
### What is a CTF?

A CTF, short for Capture The Flag, refers to a cybersecurity lab where participants are presented with a vulnerable machine and a flag.txt file. The goal is to leverage their knowledge and skills to penetrate the machine's defenses and retrieve the flag. Successfully capturing the flag signifies that the machine has been "ROOTed."<br>
### My Approach and Writeup Details:

I believe in the importance of sharing knowledge and documenting my learning journey. Hence, in this repository, I provide detailed writeups of the rooms I have successfully ROOTed during my CTF adventures. Each writeup is written in the first person, as I share my step-by-step process of tackling the challenges, highlighting the rationale behind each action taken.

By documenting my experiences, I not only solidify my understanding of the concepts but also create a valuable resource for others in the cybersecurity community. I encourage you to explore these writeups, learn from my methodologies, and build upon them.<br>
### Feedback and Corrections:

I understand that mistakes can occur, and I am eager to learn and improve. If you come across any errors or inaccuracies in my writeups, I would greatly appreciate your feedback. Feel free to reach out to me through my social media channels, where we can connect and discuss further.<br>

I hope you find these writeups informative and engaging. My intention is to contribute to the cybersecurity community by sharing my experiences and providing insights into the techniques and strategies employed during CTF challenges.

Thank you for your support, and I look forward to connecting with you on my socials. Let's continue learning and growing together in the fascinating world of cybersecurity!<br>
